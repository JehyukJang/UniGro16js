# UniGro16js

Universial Groth16 for EVM implemented in js and MATLAB

## What is the universal Groth16 for EVM?

Universal Groth16 (UniGro16) for EVM is a new zk-SNARK that inherits the succinctness of [original Groth16](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/260.pdf) while adding universality for EVM-based applications. The universality of UniGro16 can be said as EVM-specific universality, meaning that a trust setup only need to be executed when an EVM is newly- or re-defined. A universal reference string file generated by a trust setup contains proving and verifying keys for each instuction of an EVM. Thus, the universal reference string can be used for all kinds of EVM applications made of the predefined instructions.

The key idea of UniGro16 is Derive algorithm, which linearly combines the proving and verifying keys in a universal reference string according to the combination of instructions forming an EVM application. As the result, Derive outputs a circuit-specific reference string, which is specialized to an EVM application. The execution of Derive does not need a trust, so anyone can be an executor. Derive needs to be executed when an EVM-application is newly developed or updated. The structure of a circuit-specific reference string is almost equivalent with a common reference string of original Groth16's setup except only that UniGro16 uses bivarate QAP polynomials instead of univarte ones. This enables us to use prove and verify algorithms of the original Groth16, which is the fastest among all zk-SNARKs.

Based on the same application, UniGro16 might be a bit slower than the original Groth16 at the cost of universality. This is because we add redundant constraints to the circuits of EVM instructions to make room for combining them later.

## Problem formulation and contributions

Our goal is to find a compromise between the universality and performance of pairing-based SNARKs. We relax the definition of universal setup from supporting any (NP) program in the world to supporting Ethereum virtual machine (EVM) applications. EVM is a stack machine with a small instruction set of opcodes. Examples of EVM applications are transactions in the Ethereum blockchain, each just a permutation of the opcodes. With the relaxed definition of universal setup, we design a pairing-based SNARK and universal to EVM applications with better performance than existing strictly-universal SNARKs.

We propose UniGro16 as a solution to the problem. The main idea of UniGro16 is a derive algorithm that derives circuit-specific public keys from EVM-specific public keys. A trusted third party, through the setup, generates the public keys containing a commitment to every arithmetic opcode of EVM. Then, through a derive algorithm, anyone including not only a prover and verifier but also untrusted helpers derives circuit-specific public keys committing to an EVM application. The derived public keys can be applied to Groth16â€™s prove and verify algorithms. As a result, UniGro16 has two advantages: 1) No trusted third parties are required when outsourcing new EVM applications. 2) The complexity of the prover and verifier inherits the complexity of Groth16, which is known to be the lowest.

Our contributions can be summarized as follows:

- We have designed UniGro16 which consists of five algorithms: setup, decode, derive, prove and verify,
- We have implemented UniGro16 and tested it with practical EVM applications,
- We have shown that the security of UniGroth16 remains unchanged from Groth16 even with the derived public keys,
- We have shown that the public keys derived by helpers are secure, and
- We have shown that the prover and verifier complexity of UniGro16 is lower than that of strictly-universal SNARKs.

## Demo. version implementations

### Protocol composition

UniGro16 consists of eight algorithms: compile, buildQAP, generateWitness, decode, setup, derive, prove, and verify.

- **compile** takes circom implementations of all EVM instructions as inputs and outputs respective R1CSs and wasms and metadata.
- **buildQAP** takes R1CSs and an EVM parameter as inputs and outputs respective QAP polynomials
- **decode (written in MATLAB script)** takes a p-code(bytecode) of an EVM application, initial storage data, and the EVM instruction metadata as inputs and outputs instances for all instructions used in a p-code and a wire map that contaning circuit information of an EVM application.
- **setup** takes the R1CSs and EVM parameters as inputs and outputs a universal reference string.
- **derive** takes the universal reference string and the wire map as inputs and outputs a circuit-specific reference string.
- **generateWitness** takes instances and the wasms for all instructions used in a p-code as inputs and outputs respective witnesses. Each witness includes the instance as well.
- **prove** takes the circuit-specific reference string, the witnesses, the QAPs and the wire map as inputs and outputs a proof.
- **verify** takes the proof, the circuit-specific reference string, the instances, and the wire map as inputs and prints out whether the proof is valid or not.

### Explanation for the inputs and outputs

- EVM instructions: Arithmetic opcodes including keccak256 in EVM from 0x01 to 0x20
- Circom implementation: A circom script to execute an opcode and build its (sub)circuit.
