Universial Groth16 for EVM implemented in js and MATLAB

## What is the universal Groth16 for EVM?


Universal Groth16 (UGro16) for EVM is a new zk-SNARK that inherits the succinctness of [original Groth16](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/260.pdf) while adding universality for EVM-based applications. The universality of UGro16 can be said as EVM-specific universality, meaning that a trust setup only need to be executed when an EVM is newly- or re-defined. A universal reference string file generated by a trust setup contains proving and verifying keys for each instuction of an EVM. Thus, the universal reference string can be used for all kinds of EVM applications made of the predefined instructions.

The key idea of UGro16 is Derive algorithm, which linearly combines the proving and verifying keys in a universal reference string according to the combination of instructions forming an EVM application. As the result, Derive outputs a circuit-specific reference string, which is specialized to an EVM application. The execution of Derive does not need a trust, so anyone can be an executor. Derive needs to be executed when an EVM-application is newly developed or updated. The structure of a circuit-specific reference string is almost equivalent with a common reference string of original Groth16's setup except only that UGro16 uses bivarate QAP polynomials instead of univarte ones. This enables us to use prove and verify algorithms of the original Groth16, which is the fastest among all zk-SNARKs.

Based on the same application, UGro16 might be a bit slower than the original Groth16 at the cost of universality. This is because we add redundant constraints to the circuits of EVM instructions to make room for combining.

### Protocol composition

UGro16 consists of eight algorithms: compile, buildQAP, generateWitness, decode, setup, derive, prove, and verify.
- **compile** takes circom implementations of all EVM instructions as inputs and outputs respective R1CSs and wasms and metadata.
- **buildQAP** takes R1CSs and an *EVM parameter s_max*\* as inputs and outputs respective QAP polynomials
- **decode (written in MATLAB script)** takes a p-code(bytecode) of an EVM application, initial storage data, and the EVM instruction metadata as inputs and outputs instances for all instructions used in a p-code and a wire map that contaning circuit information of an EVM application.
- **setup** takes the R1CSs and EVM parameters as inputs and outputs a universal reference string.
- **derive** takes the universal reference string and the wire map as inputs and outputs a circuit-specific reference string.
- **generateWitness** takes instances and the wasms for all instructions used in a p-code as inputs and outputs respective witnesses. Each witness includes the instance as well.
- **prove** takes the circuit-specific reference string, the witnesses, the QAPs and the wire map as inputs and outputs a proof.
- **verify** takes the proof, the circuit-specific reference string, the instances, and the wire map as inputs and prints out whether the proof is valid or not.

    *\* s_max: The maximum number of arithmetic opcodes that can be contained in an EVM application.*

### Explanation for the inputs and outputs

- EVM instructions: Arithmetic opcodes including keccak256 in EVM from 0x01 to 0x20
- Circom implementation: A circom script to execute an opcode and build its (sub)circuit.
- R1CS: A set of wires and constraints forming the (sub)circuit of a circom implementation (called subcircuit)
- wasm: A script of executing an opcode ported in wasm
