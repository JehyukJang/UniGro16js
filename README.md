Universial Groth16 for EVM implemented in js and MATLAB

What is the universal Groth16 for EVM?
Universal Groth16 (UGro16) for EVM is a zk-SNARK that inherits the succinctness of original Groth16 while adding universality for EVM-based applications. The universality of UGro16 can be said as EVM-specific universality, meaning that a trust setup only need to be executed when an EVM is newly- or re-defined. A universal reference string file generated by a trust setup contains proving and verifying keys for each instuction of an EVM. Thus, the universal reference string can be used for all kinds of EVM applications made of the predefined instructions.
The key idea of UGro16 is Derive algorithm, which linearly combines the proving and verifying keys in a universal reference string according to the combination of instructions forming an EVM application. As the result, Derive outputs a circuit-specific reference string, which is specialized to an EVM application. The execution of Derive does not need a trust, so anyone can be an executor. Derive needs to be executed when an EVM-application is newly developed or updated. The structure of a circuit-specific reference string is almost equivalent with a common reference string of original Groth16's setup except only that UGro16 uses bivarate QAP polynomials instead of univarte ones. This enablues us to use the fastest prove and verify algorithms of the original Groth16.
Based on the same application, UGro16 can be a bit slower than Gro16. This is the cost of universality, because we add redundant constraints to the EVM instructions to make room for combining.
